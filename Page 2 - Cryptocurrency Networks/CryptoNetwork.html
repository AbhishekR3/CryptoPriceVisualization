        <p> Cryptocurrency is built on a network/system that is used to transfer cryptocurrencies and tokens. </p>
        <p> Certain cryptocurrencies use their own network, while others use popular networks. </p>
        <p> Ethereum is the most common network with over <a href = "https://www.coindesk.com/which-crypto-dapps-are-on-ethereum"> 3000 decentralized apps</a> </p>
        <p> If multiple cryptocurrencies use the same network/system, there are its own pros and cons. </p>
        <p> A pro is that multiple cryptocurrency will share a community and discuss and improve the network and help its users as well. </p>
        <p> A con is that the loopholes are applicable to multiple cryptocurrencies, which create bigger problems. </p>
        <p> This is what nearly happened when <a href = "https://www.coindesk.com/55m-hack-ethereum-down"> a hack nearly brought Ethereum's network down</a>.</p>

        <p> FYI: There is a reason there is negative values for the closing price.</p>
        <p> When a value is less than 1, but greater than 0, the log of that value will be a negative number. </p>
        <p> For example: OXT has a closing price of 0.445886246, the log of this value is approximately -0.351. </p>
