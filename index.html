	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The closing price has been taken in log due to the massive difference between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. On March 31st 2021, Bitcoin had the highest price of $58810.16 and Ethereum with the 2nd highest price of $1947.36, which is a staggering $56862.80 difference.</span></p>

	<p> <strong> Cryptocurrency Networks </strong> </p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptocurrency is built on a network/system that is used to transfer cryptocurrencies and tokens. Certain cryptocurrencies use their own network, while others use popular ones around. If multiple cryptocurrencies use the same network/system, there are its own pros and cons. A pro is that multiple cryptocurrency will share a community and discuss and improve the network and help its users as well. A con is that the loopholes are applicable to multiple cryptocurrencies, which create bigger problems. This is what nearly happened when a <a href="https://geekprank.com/hacker/" rel="nofollow">hack nearly</a> brought Ethereum's network down.</span></p>
