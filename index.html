    <!-- Intro to Project -->
    <p> <strong> Intro to Project </strong> </p>
    <p> Cryptocurrency is a term that is thrown around very often and it for good reason. </p>
    <p> Cryptocurrency is dubbed to be the new future of currency due to its privacy, P2P nature, and much more. </p>
    <p> To understand more about various cryptocurrencies I have created a few visualizations. </p>

    <!-- Comparing Cryptocurrncy Prices -->
    <p> <strong> Comparing Cryptocurrency Prices </strong> </p>
    <p> There are <a href = "https://e-cryptonews.com/how-many-cryptocurrencies-are-there-in-2021/">nearly 8000 cryptocurrencies </a>in the world and nearly all are constantly changing in price. </p>
    <p> Visualizing the price change over time with major cryptocurrencies seems like the best method to see how the cryptocurrency market is built. </p>
    <p> This graph contains 9 of the top 20 cryptocurrency on the market according to <a href = "https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk20">CoinDesk</a>, a news site specializing in bitcoin and digital currencies. </p>

    <!-- Cryptocurrency Networks -->
    <p> <strong> Cryptocurrency Networks </strong> </p>
    <p> Cryptocurrency is built on a network/system that is used to transfer cryptocurrencies and tokens. </p>
    <p> Certain cryptocurrencies use their own network, while others use popular networks. </p>
    <p> Ethereum is the most common network with over <a href = "https://www.coindesk.com/which-crypto-dapps-are-on-ethereum"> 3000 decentralized apps</a> </p>
    <p> If multiple cryptocurrencies use the same network/system, there are its own pros and cons. </p>
    <p> A pro is that multiple cryptocurrency will share a community and discuss and improve the network and help its users as well. </p>
    <p> A con is that the loopholes are applicable to multiple cryptocurrencies, which create bigger problems. </p>
    <p> This is what nearly happened when <a href = "https://www.coindesk.com/55m-hack-ethereum-down"> a hack nearly brought Ethereum's network down</a>.</p>
