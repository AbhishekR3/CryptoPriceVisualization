    <!-- Cryptocurrency Networks -->
    <p> <strong> Cryptocurrency Networks </strong> </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptocurrency is built on a network/system that is used to transfer cryptocurrencies and tokens. Certain cryptocurrencies use their own network, while others use popular ones around. If multiple cryptocurrencies use the same network/system, there are its own pros and cons. A pro is that multiple cryptocurrency will share a community and discuss and improve the network and help its users as well. A con is that the loopholes are applicable to multiple cryptocurrencies, which create bigger problems. This is what nearly happened when a <a href="https://geekprank.com/hacker/" rel="nofollow">hack nearly</a> brought Ethereum's network down.</span></p>
